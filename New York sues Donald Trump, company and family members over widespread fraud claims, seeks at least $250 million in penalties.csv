+ seeking 250m in damages."
">	Mar-a-Lago ""generated less than $25 million in annual revenue,"" the suit says. ""It should have been valued at about $75 million, but it was valued at $739 million

It’s also hilarious that his lawyers aren’t disputing these facts, but instead dispute the ‘intrusion’ in obtaining them."
I don’t quite understand how someone can be affiliated with so many convicted people / coworkers / associates yet continue to avoid prosecution himself despite having a continuous stream of illegal actions filed against him
"The same people who stole money from cancer charities would *never* commit fraud, I refuse to believe it."
And this is how he'll be forced to admit he's broke.
The banks who loaned him money without doing any due diligence or scrutiny of his blatant and repetitive lies should be investigated too. The only time a bank hands over a hundred million without asking questions is when they don't want questions asked about where that money came from.
250 million in damages. Good thing they just got 2 billion from the saudis to help cover their legal costs /s
"Dear MAGA Loved Ones,

Once again, I come here to ask you for money to pay my legal bills....

I love you!

Donald"
">	“Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars,” James said at a press conference. She also noted that he had falsely claimed that his apartment in Manhattan was more than triple its actual size as part of the fraud.

>	James said Trump grossly overstated the values of his assets to obtain more favorable loan and insurance terms for his company, as well as to lower its tax obligations.

This should surprise nobody.   Hopefully it comes out what his true net worth actually is."
Does he have $250 million?
Which one of his adult kids is going to turn on Donald Trump first? My money is on Ivanka.
The moron would have gotten away with all this trust fund baby fraud if he didn’t let his Twitter popularity convince him to run for president.
What's also important here is that this announcement will likely inspire prosecutors in other jurisdictions to start investigating Trump and his family. I'm convinced that the reason Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg declined to prosecute Trump is because he was too afraid to be the first one. He didn't want to risk losing and/or want to become a target of Trump personally so he chickened out. Maybe that case will move forward now that Letitia James pulled the trigger and has offered to provide the NYAG's evidence to him.
"why does a great businessman need an illegal PAC, illegal charity, illegal university, and to defraud banks and the IRS?"
"I wish someone would get all of the contractors they've stiffed over the years into a class action lawsuit for theft of services.

Or just bought up all those debts at pennies on the dollar then took Trump's family to collections."
"This lawsuit, as serious as it is, is least of Donald Trump's legal worries. There is the criminal referral to the IRS. There is the criminal investigation of the Trump Organization by the Manhattan DA. There is the election fraud investigation in Georgia. There is the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation by the DOJ. And finally, there is the rancid cherry on top of this legal layer cake: the January 6th insurrection investigation by Congress and the DOJ. At the risk of mixing my metaphors, the vice on Trump is tightening, and it's tightening fast."
"Everyone keep in mind this is a civil suit and not a criminal suit.   Great news to see but this will not result in any jail time, at least from this lawsuit.

Edit:  this is 100% good news and could absolutely lead to more changes.   I’m just clarifying what these people mean so people don’t get their hopes up from this set of charges"
"I wont be satisfied until this dude is bankrupt, in a jump suit and being defended by a public defender."
">The civil lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court seeks at least $250 million in damages, to permanently bar Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump from serving as an officer of a company in New York, **and permanently prohibit the Trump companies named in the suit from doing business in New York state.**

Does this mean that if the state wins, they'll kick him out of his building on 5th avenue? I'd love to see that big golden ""TRUMP"" sign removed."
"If this year ends in Putin's death and Trump's indictment, it would get rid of the world's 2 biggest threats to Democracy."
Math is a liberal conspiracy
I want one of the Trump kids to pull a Kendall from Succession and go completely against Trump on national television.
"I guarantee the next round of fundraising emails have already gone out to your uncle that spent $100 on a ""Trump 2024 - No More Bullshit"" flag."
Pile 'em on. Give him what he deserves. Keep him so busy he can't sleep or take a shit.
"In addition to the suit, they also made a criminal referral to federal prosecutors with the Southern District of New York. [Link](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/donald-trump-sued-for-fraud-by-ny-attorney-general-in-long-awaited-case/3874251/)"
So was Clown Prince Kushner included? Or does he get his own suit?
">James said she has asked federal prosecutors in Manhattan and to the Internal Revenue Service to investigate Trump for possible federal crimes. She said that evidence obtained during her three-year civil probe of Trump indicated possible crimes of bank fraud and making false statements to financial institutions.


This is big too....IRS don't play around..."
Another bill he won't pay.
The NYAG spent 3 years building evidence. There is zero chance this was done on a whim.
"It’s just a hunch, but I think this Trump guy might not be Presidential material."
"Better start sending out those grifter emails to MAGA land, time for the people who have nothing to start paying up"
"Things aren't looking good for the second coming of the Christ.

DJT is running out of lawyers. I'd imagine that this suit will cost at least $25M in fees. Suits last years and can tie up a lot of resources. Furthermore, anything revealed here can be reviewed by the 1/6 committee, the DOJ, Georgia's investigation and anyone else. On top of that, there's talk that women want to sue DJT for sexual assault abuse since Biden signed that legislation."
"That's why Trumpo has to run in 2024, to derail the investigations against him and his disorganized crime familia."
"Things like this stick out to me:

“James said that Trump had falsely claimed that his apartment in Manhattan was more than triple its actual size as part of the fraud.”

Like, I figured he’d misrepresent something ethereal like its market value, not literally it’s SIZE, something that can be measured by anyone with a tape measure. Does that apartment still exist? Can they literally send an agent of the court there with a tape measure?"
"I'm excited and happy, but I can't help but feel like these fucks have evaded every other suit and attempt at catching them, and so it is difficult to remain hopeful"
Suddenly being the least favourite child isn't looking so bad for Tiffany.
"Trumpites, YOU will owe NY at least $250,000,000. Don’t believe it, just wait for your Daddy to start crying and asking for the money FROM YOU. Oh he will call it something else, but he wants you to pay his bills. AS USUAL!"
"Now we get to find out if he has ""millions and millions and millions of dollars"""
Running for office was the worst thing he ever did for himself . He could have laid low but he ruffled too many feathers with his presidency and post presidency.
"""LAW AND ORDER!!""

""Not paying taxes makes me smart""

""I'm a great business man""

""Perhaps if she weren't my daughter, I'd be dating her"""
Time to go back to the well of Rubes for “donations”.
He'll have an email out to his undereducated sycophants by this afternoon telling them they need to donate to help him fight the radical left and their NY Pitbull.
"Finally some karma, it took too long but it's still good to see it happening."
He should have been prosecuted for this decades ago
"I'm hoping he can't postpone all of this indefinitely. Jail would be nice but is unlikely. At least get us a personal bankruptcy, a perp walk and a plea bargain. Enough to keep him ineligible to run again. The main GOP is probably done with him as a useful idiot anyway. 

It will probably also be years before we get the inside story on the Deutsche Bank connection to the Russian oligarchs. Waiting on the upcoming Weisselberg testimony for another possible mention of it."
"Unfortunately for New York, Trump probably only has about 1% of that."
"In addition to banning the Trump Org from taking out loans, they should also be banned from doing any kind of fundraising. Let him pay out of his own dirty pocket, for once in his pathetic life."
"I don’t celebrate any of this- this is shameful behavior in a person that needs to face consequences- we allowed this man to make a mockery of our laws, constitution and democracy- 360,000,000 and over two hundred years of history and this man gets his portrait hung next to Washington- shame shame shame on us"
This is the best news I have heard all day.
"Lock him up!!
Lock him up!!

Amazing ring to it!!"
I guess your grandparents are going to get some more robocalls from Trump's team grifting them out of their Social Security checks to pay for this.
Took 'em long enough. Fucker's been criming since the 80s.
Just 250m? Should be taking their mansions.
It really couldn’t have happened to a more deserving family.
Even money says that Trump’s current lawyer will be either disbarred or sued herself over this.
Nail him to the fucking wall already
These people really are the scum of the earth. Change my mind.
All thanks to AOC’s brilliant questioning of Michael Cohen.  Thanks AOC!!
No worries.  It won’t take long before he starts asking for money to his cult to save the country and they will buy it.
This guy nominated 3 Supreme Court judges. Bonkers
And this is why trump was so freaked out when they announced he'd won in 2016.
"Cue the ""stop breaking the law asshole"" from Liar, Liar.  Seriously though people think that Trump is being targeted for political shit, but the dude is a massive operator of illegal enterprise and has been LONG BEFORE he even became President.  There were 3,500 lawsuits before he even ran for President some lost some won.  The guy just does whatever he wants and fucks over whoever he wants and says, ""sue me"".... so people do."
Ask Al Capone about Tax evasion…
">Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, in a statement Wednesday, said, “Today’s filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law –

You sure about that?"
"I honestly don’t know how DJT sleeps at night. I lose sleep over the silliest stuff and this dude is fighting god knows how many cases, civilly and possibly criminally. Plus his long history of fraud and grifting. He has so many skeletons in his closet. I wouldn’t ever be able to get one wink of sleep with that hanging over me."
"Thank you, AG Letitia James."
I like my Presidents who DONT take the 5th
No doubt donald will be fund raising off this and his gullible ignorant base will donate.  Fucking sheep.
Guess it's time for Donny to start begging for cash again
"I encourage everyone to read the (admittedly long) complaint; it’s pretty damning. Yes: there are a lot of in-the-weeds violations of GAAP (that would put any one of *us* in federal prison), but also a whole shit ton of “they just made shit up to falsify loans and commit tax fraud” evidence there. Will he get away without doing time? Probably: our system is corrupt. Will he finally be proven a felon? I think it likely.

Edited to close paren."
Can I sue chump for ruining my family member’s brains?
"If it looks like shit, smells like shit, taste like shit, it probably is shit. Wake the fuck up Trump supporters"
"If I heard correctly the penalties include: $250M fine, dissolving his NY entities, preventing Trump entities from operating in NY, preventing Trumps (all) from managing companies in NY.  He can't move the entities to an out-of-state (shell) entity. Basically he, his family, and their companies are fucked as far as NY is concerned."
"The IRS is going to get in on the act, too! Remember Al Capone?
This could be very very satisfying.
If they televised the perp walk, he’d get more viewership than he’s ever had."
How many legal fronts are active against him at this point?
What I find unbelievably hilarious is that his ego is what got his ass in a sling. If he had stayed away from politics he’d probably still be flying under the radar. But he *had* to run for President and step into that kind of scrutiny and public focus.
"How can they do this when his IRS audit hasn't been completed? 

/s"
"Seeing conservatives play the 'rules for thee, but not for me' card. If only we could think of a high profile Democrat Letitia James has taken down recently. Maybe, I dunno, a governor of some kind?"
I'm just hoping for something that bars him from being president or a senator ever.  He will fade away. Right now his followers follow blindly but they'll have to wake sooner or later.
"The harshest penalty here is being overlooked: disgorgement. If you obtain a loan under false pretenses, you have to pay it back immediately if you’re found out. That is what would bankrupt him in this. They also don’t want him to be able to borrow money from a New York bank for 5 years, or any bank licensed in New York, so it would be pretty hard to try and refinance."
"This mofo told people his apartment is worth THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

..he literally was like, ""yo. Lawyer... Add a zero. --trust me, they like that""

LOL"
Everyone but Tiffany. You go girl.
I'm starting to get the feeling this Trump Family might not be on the up and up....
Best hands free orgasm I've ever had
I’m shocked.  The guy who is a known grifter and conman since the 80’s has allegedly committed fraud?
